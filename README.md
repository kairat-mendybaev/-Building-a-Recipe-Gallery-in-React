# Recipe Gallery

## Description

This React application displays a gallery of recipes. Each recipe is shown in a card format that includes the recipe title, an image, and a list of ingredients.

## Layout and Styling

- The gallery uses CSS Grid for a responsive layout that adjusts nicely to different screen sizes.
- Each card has a slight shadow and border for better visual separation.
- The images are styled to cover the allocated area, maintaining their aspect ratio.

## Running the Application

To view the recipe gallery:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the application.

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
